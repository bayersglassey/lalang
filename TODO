    * enumerate
    * sorted (first add list .reverse, then use it for this)
    * reversed (first add list .sort, then use it for this)
    * map
    * filter
    * ...can we add some kind of fancy way to do comprehensions?..
[ ] cli options
[X] locals
[ ] we have func->args, how about func->kwargs?.. i.e. stored locals?..
    we could probably even handle this in the compiler, if we detect references
    within a func (i.e. is_func=true) to variables belonging to a parent func
[ ] parentheses, i.e. stack assertions
[X] single-character string cache, "abc" .get should be "a", etc
[ ] unit tests
[X] modules
[ ] C extensions
    ...see extensions/nlist.c!.. need to compile it, and implement a @cimport builtin
[ ] break, continue, return?..
[ ] use from Python
[ ] support negative list indexes
[ ] list slices (ITER_LIST_SLICE, or just reuse ITER_LIST and add more info to it)
