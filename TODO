[X] functions
[X] conditionals
[X] custom classes
[ ] iterators
[ ] standard library
[ ] cli options
[X] locals
[ ] we have func->args, how about func->kwargs?.. i.e. stored locals?..
    we could probably even handle this in the compiler, if we detect references
    within a func (i.e. is_func=true) to variables belonging to a parent func
[ ] parentheses, i.e. stack assertions
[X] single-character string cache, "abc" .get should be "a", etc
[ ] unit tests
[X] modules

[ ] break, continue, return?..
[ ] use from Python
